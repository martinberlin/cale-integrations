    <h3>Privacy Policy for Data recollected by Google</h3>

        <h4>Google Measurement Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms</h4>
        <p>The Measurement Services customer agreeing to these terms (“<strong>Customer</strong>”) has entered into an agreement with either Google or a third party reseller (as applicable) for the provision of the Measurement Services (as amended from time to time, the “<strong>Agreement</strong>”) through which services user interface Customer has enabled the Data Sharing Setting.</p>

            <p>These Google Measurement Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms (“<strong>Controller Terms</strong>”) are entered into by Google and Customer. Where the Agreement is between Customer and Google, these Controller Terms supplement the Agreement. Where the Agreement is between Customer and a third party reseller, these Controller Terms form a separate agreement between Google and Customer.</p>

            <p>For the avoidance of doubt, the provision of the Measurement Services is governed by the Agreement. These Controller Terms set out the data protection provisions relating to the Data Sharing Setting only but do not otherwise apply to the provision of the Measurement Services.</p>

            <p>Subject to Section 7.2 (Processor Terms), these Controller Terms will be effective, and replace any previously applicable terms relating to their subject matter, from the Terms Effective Date.</p>

            <p>If you are accepting these Controller Terms on behalf of Customer, you warrant that: (a) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to these Controller Terms; (b) you have read and understand these Controller Terms; and (c) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to these Controller Terms. If you do not have the legal authority to bind Customer, please do not accept these Controller Terms.</p>

            <p>Please do not accept these Controller Terms if you are a reseller. These Controller Terms set out the rights and obligations that apply between users of the Measurement Services and Google.</p>

            <p>If Google is:</p>

            <ul class="no-bullets">
                <li>(a) party to the Agreement and the Agreement is governed by the laws of:
                    <ul class="no-bullets">
                        <li>(i) a state of the United States of America, then, notwithstanding anything else in the Agreement, the total liability of either party towards the other party under or in connection with these Controller Terms will be limited to the maximum monetary or payment-based amount at which that party’s liability is capped under the Agreement (for clarity, any exclusion of indemnification claims from the Agreement’s limitation of liability will not apply to indemnification claims under the Agreement relating to the Data Protection Legislation); or</li>
                        <li>(ii) a jurisdiction that is not a state of the United States of America, then the liability of the parties under or in connection with these Controller Terms will be subject to the exclusions and limitations of liability in the Agreement; or</li>

            </ul>

            <h4>7. Priority</h4>

            <h3>7.1 Effect of these Controller Terms</h3>

            <p>If Google is party to the Agreement and there is any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of these Controller Terms and the remainder of the Agreement then, subject to Sections 4.2 (Restrictions on Processing) and 7.2 (Processor Terms), the terms of these Controller Terms will govern. Subject to the amendments in these Controller Terms, the Agreement between Google and Customer remains in full force and effect.</p>

            <h3>7.2 Processor Terms</h3>

            <p>These Controller Terms will not replace or affect any Processor Terms.

                <li>(b) does not: (i) seek to alter the categorisation of the parties as independent controllers of Controller Personal Data under the Data Protection Legislation; (ii) expand the scope of, or remove any restrictions on, either party’s rights to use or otherwise process Controller Personal Data; or (iii) have a material adverse impact on Customer, as reasonably determined by Google.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>8.2 Notification of Changes</h3>

            <p>If Google intends to change these Controller Terms under Section 8.1(a) and such change will have a material adverse impact on Customer, as reasonably determined by Google, then Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to inform Customer at least 30 days (or such shorter period as may be required to comply with applicable law, applicable regulation, a court order or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or agency) before the change will take effect. If Customer objects to any such change, Customer may switch off the Data Sharing Setting.</p>
