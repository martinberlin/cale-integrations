# This file is the entry point to configure your own services.
# Files in the packages/ subdirectory configure your dependencies.

# Put parameters here that don't need to change on each machine where the app is deployed

parameters:
    # ex.             http://calendar.fasani.de/screenshot/cale.php?u=http://calendar.fasani.de/paulina&w=400&h=300&d=1
    screenshot_host: 'http://calendar.fasani.de'

    # default configuration for services in *this* file
    _defaults:
        autowire: true      # Automatically injects dependencies in your services.
        autoconfigure: true # Automatically registers your services as commands, event subscribers, etc.

    # makes classes in src/ available to be used as services
    # this creates a service per class whose id is the fully-qualified class name

    # controllers are imported separately to make sure services can be injected
    # as action arguments even if you don't extend any base controller class

    # add more service definitions when explicit configuration is needed
